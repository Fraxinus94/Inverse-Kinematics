### Inverse-Kinematics Demo
This project was built using Raylib for the graphics side. You can find Raylib [here](https://www.raylib.com/).

If you wish to compile this project, make sure you have raylib installed and configure your IDE appropriately to include it. 

This demo shows off a simple graphical example of [inverse kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics).

The bones, or segments, will follow the circle that bounces around the screen. You can increase/decrease the length and the amount of bones during runtime by using the arrow keys.

Controls:
- UP increases the bone count.
- Down decreases the bone count.
- Left decreases the bone length.
- Right increases the bone length.
